Portal Tech Questions

1. Where will contacts get populated from (ie. user reference data)?
2. Will they take a distinct set of contacts from PMT/TPR?
3. How will Portal Tech manage new contacts? (Feed from PMT/TPR)
4. What will we match the contact on? (email address, first name + last name etc?)
5. Do the different systems store the contact name the same?


TPR
1. How do we identify the contact role?
2. Do we need a mapping exercise for CM_CONTACT.CCO_TITLE to DEV, PUB, LEAD_DEV
